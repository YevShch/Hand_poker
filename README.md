## ♠️ Poker hand comparer - workshop on writing unit tests and running via GitHub Actions  

### Workshop Overview
The workshop focuses on implementing and testing a program for comparing poker hands, exploring different testing strategies, and automating the testing process.

### Key objectives include:

**Writing Code and Tests:** 
 Tests should cover positive cases (where a hand has a specific combination), negative cases (where a hand does not have the combination), and comparative cases (where both hands have combinations, and the correct hand should win or score higher).

**Exploring Alternative Oracles:** 
 This could include existing programs that compare poker hands, databases, or external datasets. The goal is to investigate whether these oracles can be integrated into the testing process.

**Automating Tests with GitHub Actions:** 
The final step involves integrating tests into GitHub Actions, ensuring that they run automatically upon pushing code changes to GitHub. This will allow continuous testing and validation of the program as the codebase evolves.

**Exploring HiVat Tests:**
 Introducing to the concept of HiVat testing (Highly Variable Automated Testing) and thinking about how to implement or integrate these types of tests into their workflow.
